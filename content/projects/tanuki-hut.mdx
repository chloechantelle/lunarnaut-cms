description: As an upcoming Product Designer, I undertook a project that focused on the UX and visual design of a sleek and modern mountain biking business that focused primarily on nature and the key values of a green economic initiative. As the designer I'm responsible for both engineering and creating an engaging user experience and a proficient interface for the brand that held both the companies values and aesthetic, as seen below.

<h2>Strategy & UX</h2>

<p>In this project, my main goal was to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience for visitors to the mountain biking business website. I wanted to convey the values of nature and an business ethic represented by the while maintaining a modern and visually pleasing design.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I started by conducting user research and gathering feedback from potential users of the website. This helped me understand their needs and expectations, allowing me to tailor the UX design accordingly. I focused on ensuring intuitive navigation, clear and concise information, and easy access to important features such as catalogues and exploring different informational sources that the user can access.</p>

<p>Below is a sample of the wireframes I created during the UX phase of the project; I did a competitive/comparative analysis to understand the best practices and opportunities for user flow and competitor advantage.</p>

        <h2>Aesthetics & UI</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of visual design, I aimed for a sleek and modern aesthetic
            that showcased the colour palette utilized by the business itself,
            whilst representing the powerful and elegant design that the bikes
            represent.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a proficient interface, I employed a minimalist approach
            that prioritized content and functionality. The website featured a
            clean and organized layout with clear typographic hierarchy, making
            it easy for users to scan and find relevant information. I also
            ensured that information is easily discovered and the interactive
            assets were highly visible, facilitating the user's journey and
            encouraging interactivity.

        <h2>User Control</h2>
        <p>
            As part of the websites design, I wanted to introduce layering forms
            of interactivity that would assist the user in being directly in
            control of what they wanted to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            Giving users the tools to access the various pages directly was the
            goal of the project, providing the user with a flow of the websites
            layout via a key off to the side that they can access and choose
            from.
        </p>
        <p>
            This allowed for the user to attain information in minimal clicks
            and screentime.
        </p>
