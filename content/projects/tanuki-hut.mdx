<h1>Project Goal</h1>

<p>
    The goal of the project was to produce a brand identity for a Japanese
    Business named Tanuki Hut; the location of their business was located on 8
    street in Garden City, a location that featured a large portion of Japanese
    restaurants. With this knowledge in mind I was tasked with creating an
    identity that would stand out from the typical surrounding restaurant
    indentities. (all images and assets belong to their respective copyright

        <h1>Identity & Research</h1>
        <p>
            The first step in the project was to research identity within
            Japanese Culture, to understand and establish what identity would
            separate itself from competitor identities.
        </p>
        <p>
            After much research and competitor analysis, a series of cultural
            brand logos was created and once was eventually selected to be the
            key image of the brand Identity; The logo for Tanuki Hut features a
            stylized image of a Tanuki, embracing both the playful and
            mischievous nature of the animal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The deep green and brown colours used in the logo and throughout the
            brand's visuals symbolize nature, health, and sustainability.

    <h1>Menu Design & Aesthetic</h1>
    <p>
        The menu design and marketing materials incorporate Japanese-inspired
        motifs, such as a Feudal Japanese inspired typography alongside a
        variety of Japanese dishes and soups alongside dark green and brown
        earth-tone colours to connect its identity to nature and its cuddly
        character; paw prints of the Tanuki are also present within the headings
        of each menu listing, this not only creates a visually appealing
        aesthetic but also reinforces the brand's connection to Japanese
        culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        To further emphasize their commitment to veganism and healthy eating,
        Tanuki Hut offers a menu consisting solely of plant-based options. This
        aligns perfectly with their mascot, as the Tanuki represents good
        fortune and positive energy; and also the earth-tones used.
    </p>
    <p>
        The motto, "A Taste of Good Luck," reflects the belief that choosing
        healthy, vegan foods can bring positivity and good fortune into one's
        life. It also serves as a reminder that Tanuki Hut is dedicated to
        providing customers with not only delicious but also nutritious options.

        <h1>Business Identity</h1>
        <p>
            Once the design was finalized, and the content organized and the
            menu written in a clear and concise manner, I then moved onto
            business supplies for the Tanuki Hut Shareholders, as the project
            wanted me to provide both a rebranding of assets, I had created a
            new brand identity card that represented the Tanuki Hut brand,
            utilizing established typography, components and assets such as
            colour palettes and Business Logo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also upon the design featured all of their contact information
            alongside location of Tanuki Hut.

        <h1>Business Uniform</h1>
        <p>
            A business uniform for the Tanuki Hut Business was also created,
            representing all of the aesthetic present within the menu and the
            brand identity itself, featuring two versions with pre-established
            typography and components used within the Menu and other Assets.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        Tanuki Hut was a fun opportunity to let me draw on my creativity to
        create a project that lined with my own personal interests, and it
        allowed me create a brand identity that, I feel, stood out against
        competitors in the Japanese Cuisine industry; The producing of a menu
        for a restaurant was a new experience for me and it let me push my
        skills while under the conditions of restraints, and for that I believe
        itâ€™s increased my skills as a designer.
