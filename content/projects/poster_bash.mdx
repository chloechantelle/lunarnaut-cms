description: The Poster Bash Project was a project that required me to produce a series of Posters that advertise movie posters, a convention poster or a poster that represented an art style in history and educational posters. Each poster was to advertise something whether it is an event, a source of entertainment, a stylistic impression or educational purposes, and then the projects themselves would have to become print ready and ready for use.

<h1>Project Goal</h1>

<p>
    The aim of the Poster Bash Project was to showcase my skills and creativity
    in designing visually captivating and informative posters. The project
    required me to create various posters, including movie posters, convention
    posters, and posters representing different art styles in history and
    education. (all images and assets belong to their respective copyright
    holders.)

        <h1>As Above, so Below</h1>
        <p>
            ‘As Above, So Below’ is a poster that represents a Lovecraftian
            horror film, it was produced by finding separate stock images and
            assets and combining them to produce this horror poster.
        </p>
        <p>
            The separate assets such as the hand actually originally was apart
            of a woman dancing, removing her hand from the stock image and
            placing it on a background image of the ocean and editing the
            colours and tone, alongside placing octopus tentacles on the picture
            and editing them produced this thriller flick; Using bold typography
            and complimenting colours of red and white provided a boldness the
            design.

        <h1>It Stirs</h1>
        <p>
            ‘It Stirs’ is another Lovecraftian horror poster that represents a
            film of the same as the previous’ nature, it was produced by finding
            stock images and assets and combining and editing them to produce
            this horror poster.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Stock image itself was original a plain generic image of a
            lighthouse on a coast, after some lengthy editing and applying
            octopus tentacle assets and drawing their blurred reflections in the
            water below.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also strongly edited the lighting, applying contrasting colouring
            of black and whites and applying a strong green at the top of the
            lighthouse it cemented its design as a giant Octopus emerging around
            this cursed lighthouse.

        <h1>Game Festival 2022</h1>
        <p>
            ‘Gamefest 2022’ is a designed poster that represents a gaming
            convention similar to that of E3 or Comicon, it was produced by
            attaining a stock image of a convention and applying edits upon it
            to accurately represent the convention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design itself after applying a duotone edit of the stock image
            required me to then create the assets, such as using Adobe
            Illustrator to create the vector assets of the controller and the
            other components and applying them onto the edited design.
        </p>
        <p>
            After applying the assets I would then provide the information of
            the page and then creating the title logo while following the colour
            palette established in the design.

        <h1>The City of Tomorrow</h1>
        <p>
            ‘The City of Tomorrow’ is a design that accurately represents the
            Art Deco Phase of artistic direction and architecture and their
            applications on media and graphic design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Image used within the Poster was drawn by me, inspired by an
            existing IP of Bioshock and the City of Rapture, an underwater city
            that utilizes Art Deco in its design; I created the image to
            represent the use of Art Deco in modern media and design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The foregrounds design I had created after intensive research on Art
            Deco Motif and the art styles’ wayfarers. After creating the poster
            I would then use popular Art Deco Typography to complete the
            informative design.

        <p>
            The Design itself I decided to feature a very corporate Memphis
            style and incorporate into the design alongside gradients and lines
            to lead the user through the information and a precise manner.

        the ‘Lore’ project was a separate project that's goal was to design an

        separate posters expanding over; each poster represents different
        aspects of the Mythology, from the Greek Titans, The King of the Gods
        and the Gods who fought the Titans.
