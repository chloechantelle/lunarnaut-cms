    <h1>Dessert First</h1>
    <p>
        ‘Dessert First’ was a concept project I had worked on that would be a
        Cook book for all different kind of dessert needs, the design of it
        itself was to represent the 1950’s aesthetic of diners and cafes that
        you might find such meals and delicacies of the time within. (All images
        and assets belong to their respective copyright holders.)

    <h1>Astrophobia</h1>
    <p>
        ‘Astrophobia’ was to serve as a conceptual entry to a science magazine
        which was part of a project; it’s meant to represent the fears of space
        and aliens, sporting hand-drawn assets using simple design to represent
        the contents, upon simply viewing the magazine entry one can see what
        it’s about and the message it strives for.

<div className="centered">
    <h1>The Garden of Secrets</h1>
    <p>
        ‘The Garden of Secrets’ was a simple concept project that required me to
        produce the front cover of a book design with just a name given to me, I
        felt as if the hidden text behind roses portrayed the sense of secrecy
        given in the title name with roses representing the intrigue and
        mystery.

        <h1>Koi Lighthouse (Front)</h1>
        <p>
            ‘Koi Lighthouse’ was an album cover for a vinyl that I had to
            produce using a self-taken photograph (the sky background and rubber
            duck) alongside hand-drawn assets and stock imagery.

        <p>
            The design also was to feature a photograph (the sky background and
            rubber duck) with other drawn and stock assets, alongside
            information of the album and the designers and information of the
            album owners.

<div className="centered">
    <h1>Swanson Spice</h1>
    <p>
        Swanson Spice was a packaging project that required me to produce
        varying packages of a consistent and continuous design of a brand but
        producing it for at least 3 different products. Swanson Spice was a
        brand identity and product I had designed that represented early 1800’s
        lumberjacks and their masculine energy and combining it with a nature,
        green-oriented male beard and general health and cleanliness brand and
        packaging.
