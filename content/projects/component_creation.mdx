description: These assets were created in several varying projects, they would serve as Illustratory graphics or Website components/assets or serve as intros or loading screens. They represent my passion for creating 3D & 2D assets and applying them in illustratory, video or animation purposes.

<h1>Lunarnaut Brand Assets</h1>

<p>
    Lunarnaut is one of the Brand Identity’s I’ve created that were to feature a
    very specific identity and list of components and assets that I created to
    allow for a constant level of continuity with the design and art direction;
    with brainstorming and research I was able to produce a brand that I felt
    represented my key ideals of yearning to discover and better my skills as a
    designer and the desire to explore uncharted techniques to strengthen my
    repertoire and to become the best designer I can be.

        <h1>Lunarnaut Animated</h1>
        <p>
            This animation would serve as the face of the Lunarnaut website,
            featuring a star chart background of the constellations, two SVG’s
            of the moons phases that would be animated and spin on each side of
            the screen with the Brand Mascot, Esus, in the center holding a
            small black hole.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Symbolism featured was to represent mans conquering of even the
            most fearful concepts, that being the all-consuming black hole, and
            the charting of the unknown, hence the star chat.

<h1>Corvine Design Brand Assets</h1>

<p>
    Corvine Design was a previous iteration of Lunarnaut that featured some similar but also different Components that I had created and drawn up, it also let me produce a level of continuity with the design by following the component library I had built and worked off it, utilizing very specific imagery, art direction and typography; however the use of its assets are now defunct, they still represent the brand identity that I had developed at the time.

        <h1>Corvine Design Loading</h1>
        <p>
            This loading screen asset was produced as a proof of concept for
            future loading screens that could potentially be used in both a high
            fidelity or low fidelity uses; Some of the assets present were taken
            from stock assets but there were also sections of the assets that
            were hand designed, such as the animations, backgrounds used as the
            Operating System and the art assets such as the pixelated loading
            icon.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aesthetic was meant to represent a 1980’s post-apocalyptic
            futuristic wasteland vibe, often seen in Blade Runner or Akira.

        <h1>Corvine Animated Assets</h1>
        <p>
            Present in this short video are some animations I had put together
            utilizing Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
            The changing of the image was to represent a function present on the
            website where the image would be a still image but when hovering
            over the access button to peruse the Portfolios documents, the image
            would change and augment, its intention was to add a level of
            interactivity to the website and represent personality of the
            websites aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Pixel art served as a loading screen that would play when the
            websites assets were loading.

        <h1>Corvine Design Alt</h1>
        <p>
            The Original idea of Corvine Design was somewhat simpler in design,
            featuring a crow with feathers which would adhere to its title
            identity of ‘Corvine’, however as the brand identity became more
            technical and the personality and aesthetic shifted the logo and
            feel of the brand identity shifted.
        </p>
        <p>
            This video concept was created in Blender, creating a 3D asset of a
            2D version of the image was made and implemented in an animation
            that required technical knowledge to produce the setting and
            aesthetic.

            This is a variation of the Concept video, sporting a crimson design,
            eventually after producing both version they would, in a sense,
            combine and would exist in the later part of the Alternate version,
            but also serving as a later colour palette design towards the later
            iterations with reds, blacks and whites.
