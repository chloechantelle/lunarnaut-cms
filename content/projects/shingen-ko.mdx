        <h1>Thorough Research</h1>
        <p>
            The first step in the project was to research the history of
            Shingen-Ko and gather any relevant information about the festival.
            This included learning about Takeda Shingen's achievements and his
            significance in Japanese history, as well as understanding the
            cultural importance of the festival itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Researching the task was challenging as the Festival itself is
            typically a local affair and information was scarce; however
            translating information and reaching out to historical research
            officials of the Yamanashi Prefecture provided valuable sources of
            information that was fruitful and both historically accurate.

        <h1>Aesthetic & Design</h1>
        <p>
            After gathering the necessary information, the next step was to
            design the layout of the booklet. This involved choosing a suitable
            format and deciding on the overall aesthetic, including the colour
            scheme, typography, and imagery. The booklet was designed to have a
            cohesive look and feel that would reflect the rich history and
            tradition of Shingen-Ko.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Aesthetic and Design of the Project itself was chosen and
            created to perfectly represent the ancient culture of Japan during
            the Edo Period, using strong colour representation of the Japanese
            Flag and the Nations colours of white, black and red; alongside
            symbolism of the ancient Samurai and using a typography that fits
            the cultural period and artistic direction of the project.

        <h1>Concise & Precise</h1>
        <p>
            Once the design was finalized, the content was then organized and
            written in a clear and concise manner. The information included in
            the booklet covered various aspects of the festival, such as the
            main events, cultural performances, traditional food, and practical
            information for visitors. Additionally, frequently asked questions
            (FAQs) were included to address common queries from festivalgoers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scheduled events and their times and dates were also included within
            the booklet alongside a map of the event and where the Samurai March
            would take place and lead was integral for the tourists and
            interested participants to have a tool capable of tracking the
            events.

        <h1>Quality Control</h1>
        <p>
            To ensure accuracy and quality, the content was reviewed and edited
            multiple times before being finalized. Care was taken to maintain
            historical accuracy and provide up-to-date information about the
            festival. Alongside the correct representation that would be
            featured alongside the artwork and informational texts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fact-checking information and providing accurate information was key
            to the projects success, to create historical substance within the
            work both symbolically and historically was priority; targeting the
            historical market and providing high levels of respect to the source
            material was an important factor.

        <h1>Last Steps</h1>
        <p>
            The final step of the project was to make sure the project was
            print-ready, correcting image DPI quality and selecting proper CMYK
            colour choices for the project alongside prepping typography files
            to be sent to the printer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theoretically, the project would now be printed using high-quality
            paper and ink to ensure a professional finish and then would be
            distributed to various locations in Kofu City, such as tourist
            information centres, hotels, and shops, where festivalgoers could
            easily access it.
