<h2>Strategy & UX</h2>

<p>
    The UX design featured within this Project was designed to streamline the
    progress of the user, this user-centric approach enhances the overall user
    experience by making it easier and more efficient for users to navigate
    through the project. By offering multiple methods of accessing information,
    such as droboxes and informational tabs, the user flow design ensures that
    users can choose the option that best suits their preferences and needs.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, this UX design focuses on providing a seamless and intuitive user
    flow, enhancing the overall user experience. By streamlining the progress of
    the user and providing multiple methods of accessing information, it ensures
    that users can easily find and interact with the desired content, resulting
    in a more user-centric design approach.

        <h2>User Control & UX</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main goals I wanted to achieve with the websites user
            flow was being able to achieve a simple yet elegant flow that would
            lead the user to aspects of the site with minimal amounts of clicks
            and time lost in the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted an easy flow with button presses that lead exactly to
            what's desired, and multiple ways this information and sources can
            be reached and found by providing varying means of access, such as a
            highlight tab to my best works, or a drop down box that will take
            the user to the entire portfolio category.

        <h2>Aesthetics & UI</h2>
        <p>
            One of the key features of Lunarnaut is its responsive design. The
            website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring
            that users can access the content seamlessly from any device. This
            enhances the user experience and allows for a wider reach of the
            website's portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of visual design, Lunarnaut incorporates a minimalist
            approach with a focus on space-related imagery. The sleek white
            background represents purity and simplicity and hope, while the
            black secondary color adds a touch of elegance and sophistication
            and the endless possibilities found in deep space. The use of
            space-themed images and graphics further reinforces the futuristic
            concept and creates a sense of human development and its desire to
            conquer the stars and seek out the unknown.

        <h2>Responsive Flow</h2>
        <p>
            In collaboration with a skilled developer, we ensured that the user
            experience is optimized, allowing for efficient flow of
            accessibility and information. Users have multiple methods to access
            the desired content, ensuring a user-centric approach.

        <p>
            The overall goal of Lunarnaut is to showcase the versatility and
            repertoire of skills I possess. By featuring assets and components
            from graphic design, digital illustration, and product design, I
            aimed for Lunarnaut to be a visually stunning and user-friendly
            portfolio website that effectively showcases the talents and
            capabilities I create and represent; with its efficient and
            streamlined design, it provides users with an immersive experience
            and invites them to explore the endless possibilities of space.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        It was an interesting experience creating a variation of a completed
        product, it let me experience issues that weren’t otherwise found in the
        original such as a day/night mode and reintegrating components that were
        previously created and used in the project and changing their elements
        to fit the new versions; this project also had a store integrated in the
        design that the previous iteration didn’t as it was mostly just for
        showing off the websites aesthetic and layout.
