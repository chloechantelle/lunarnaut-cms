        <h1>User Control & UX</h1>
        <p>
            One of the main goals I wanted to achieve with the websites user
            flow was being able to achieve a simple yet elegant flow that would
            lead the user to aspects of the site with minimal amounts of clicks
            and time lost in the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted an easy flow with button presses that lead exactly to
            what's desired, and multiple ways this information and sources can
            be reached and found by providing varying means of access, such as a
            highlight tab to my best works, or a drop down box that will take
            the user to the entire portfolio category.

        <h1>Aesthetics & UI</h1>
        <p>
            One of the key features of Lunarnaut is its responsive design. The
            website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring
            that users can access the content seamlessly from any device. This
            enhances the user experience and allows for a wider reach of the
            website's portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of visual design, Lunarnaut incorporates a minimalist
            approach with a focus on space-related imagery. The sleek white
            background represents purity and simplicity and hope, while the
            black secondary color adds a touch of elegance and sophistication
            and the endless possibilities found in deep space. The use of
            space-themed images and graphics further reinforces the futuristic
            concept and creates a sense of human development and its desire to
            conquer the stars and seek out the unknown.

        <h1>Responsive Flow</h1>
        <p>
            In collaboration with a skilled developer, we ensured that the user
            experience is optimized, allowing for efficient flow of
            accessibility and information. Users have multiple methods to access
            the desired content, ensuring a user-centric approach.

        <p>
            The overall goal of Lunarnaut is to showcase the versatility and
            repertoire of skills I possess. By featuring assets and components
            from graphic design, digital illustration, and product design, I
            aimed for Lunarnaut to be a visually stunning and user-friendly
            portfolio website that effectively showcases the talents and
            capabilities I create and represent; with its efficient and
            streamlined design, it provides users with an immersive experience
            and invites them to explore the endless possibilities of space.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        Overall the project itself was a learning experience, discovering what
        both made and broke the previous iterations helped to achieve what was
        created in the Lunarnaut project for both the Product Designer (Myself)
        and the Developer, the open dialogue sessions we had allowed for us to
        view and analyze what makes an effective portfolio website and we
        believe we the final product was a fruitful one.
