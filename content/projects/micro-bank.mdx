description: MicroBank was a group project that consisted of a handful of other designers given the task of producing a bank app that’s primary feature was having a form of a group-pay that a series of users that existed in the group itself would all be able to track and pay rent or bills and have it be visible to the group; the target demographic was typically people in university or other such shared living situations.

<h1>Strategy & UX</h1>

<p>
    The goal of the project was to produce a functional application for banking
    that utilized a feature for a group-pay system that a series of users could
    monitor and take part in, the challenge itself was that half way through the
    projects creation the task would be altered, initially just being a banking
    app with a design and an idea in mind, only with a minimal amount of time
    left were we to integrate the group-pay system and having it naturally flow
    and be a part of the initial project.
</p>

<p>
    We had begun user research in asking the designers in the group alongside
    faculty of the project to give us their experiences with mobile banking apps
    alongside user research, absorbing information from interviews and surveys
    on what a user would enjoy in the app that might make their flow and use
    easier and more manageable, we had delved into competitor/comparative
    analysis, that proved fruitful on utilization of the best practices and user
    flow that gain an advantage against competitor applications.
</p>

<p>
    Below are the wireframes samples we had produced during the phases of
    research and UX analysis, focusing on the production of a bank app that
    allowed for the usual utilization of a bank app, taking user flow and
    experience into account alongside the user interactivity to gain access to
    all sources of information desired by the user.

        <h1>Aesthetics & UI</h1>
        <p>
            The idea of the design itself was pre-established before the
            creation of the application, MicroBank, given to us by the faculty
            of the project and a rough outline of what was expected began the
            creation period of the application, MicroBank being a literal micro
            bank that the user could use on their phone for online banking
            services.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had taken Colour Theory into account in the creation process,
            competitor analysis revealed to us that blue was a strong colour
            used in the handling of information and trust in both graphic design
            and marketing applications, so it made sense to follow the aesthetic
            and palette of blues to give the user a sense of calm, control and
            trust with the handling of their funds and information; followed by
            a aptly designed logo of a shield, a lock and a fingerprint to
            symbolize it’s online secure nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UI design is a modernistic yet simple design that utilizes
            trends popular in the PD and GD industries; the components used were
            designed to create a simple and efficient flow for the user whilst
            providing information that the user can find.

        <h1>User Control</h1>
        <p>
            The primary objective to the project is to give the user the option
            to access their account details and information via menus or tabs
            for easier, efficient user flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking accessibility into account with varying flow paths a user can
            take to arrive at their desired destination within the app; doing
            this will allow the user to check their bills and account management
            whilst also being able to monitor their group-pay management system
            both as an owner or a group member.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        Creating a project with many varying voices, ideas and opinions was a
        new experience when designing something, it streamlined a lot of the
        UI/UX by having multiple people working on different pieces and
        providing their inputs on accessibility and interactivity, it helped
        broaden the project and provided insights that I may of otherwise missed
        when working independently.
