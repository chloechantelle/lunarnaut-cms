<h1>Strategy & UX</h1>

<p>
    To start the project, I conducted research to determine the target audience
    and their expectations when visiting a portfolio website. I also explored
    and analysed other portfolio websites to gather inspiration and understand
    current trends in the industry.
</p>

<p>
    Based on my research, I created wireframes and mock-ups to outline the
    structure and visual design of the website. This involved designing a
    user-friendly and intuitive navigation system, considering the user flow,
    and organizing the content in a visually appealing way.

        <h1>Collaborative Efforts</h1>
        <p>
            The collaboration with the developer was crucial in bringing the
            website to life. We worked closely together to ensure that the
            design translated well into code and that all the necessary
            functionality was implemented. This included integrating features
            such as image galleries, sliders, and animations to enhance the user
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the development process, I continuously tested the
            website on different devices and browsers to ensure proper
            functionality and responsiveness. I also made sure that the
            website's performance was optimized to provide a smooth and fast
            browsing experience.

        <h1>Aesthetic & UI</h1>
        <p>
            The aesthetic and UI design elements are of a dark apocalyptic
            cyberpunk visual, featuring strong contrasting colours of black and
            white, which creates a captivating and immersive experience for
            users who browse the website and portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stark contrast and visual intensity of these colours elevate the
            overall appeal of the design, making it visually striking and
            memorable. The UI design, based on this aesthetic, use typography
            and interactive components that enhance the cyberpunk vibe; using
            animation components that visually immerse the user and further
            expands on the personality of the portfolio holder and the products
            they represent.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        The design of the project itself was consistent, however upon producing
        the site and pushing it live I felt as if there was a severe lacking of
        user flow, what I once thought was effective and efficient proved
        otherwise, focusing on a grid layout for informational design proved
        lacking as the users who accessed the website itself found that it was
        difficult to find the desired information they looked for and the lack
        of informational hierarchy was present, there was no highlighted
        information in any of the designs and was only a grid format, because of
        this the user would lose interest in accessing the sites contents; I
        sought to rectify these issues after feedback with the Lunarnaut
        Project.
