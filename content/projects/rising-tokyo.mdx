description: The Rising Tokyo Project was a challenge that required me to produce a new Brand Identity for country or a city, replacing the old brand. The Challenge was using the country’s culture and ideals that would accurately represent their identity. The task itself required strenuous research phases and resource gathering to produce an end result.

<h1>Project Goal</h1>

<p>
    The goal of the project was to produce a brand identity for a Japanese
    Business named Tanuki Hut; the location of their business was located on 8
    street in Garden City, a location that featured a large portion of Japanese
    restaurants. With this knowledge in mind I was tasked with creating an
    identity that would stand out from the typical surrounding restaurant
    identities. (all images and assets belong to their respective copyright

<h1>Investigation Period</h1>

<p>
    This investigation period of the target demographic of Japan for the Rising
    Tokyo project featured in-depth and intensive research of Japans Current
    Metropolitan Government Brand Identity and the history of Japans Political
    symbolism and the general historical and symbolic significance of Japan’s
    identity ranging from colour and imagery symbolism.

    An analysis of the perceived and historical identity of Japan, the target
    identities of representation in society, and the potential challenges that
    me be faced when rebranding Japan’s Metropolitan Government.

    <h1>Brand Identity</h1>
    <p>
        This Section of the Brand Identity Project focused on the use of the new
        established brand, following procedures that are necessary when using
        the Rising Tokyo Brand Identity, such as using the correct colour
        palette when necessary, using the correct Typography when utilizing the
        brands identity, and only using validated brand variations.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s also important not to use the brands components in an incorrect
        manner that may destroy or incorrectly represent the brands image, which
        is why I featured a section covering incorrect Brand treatment.

    <h1>Mockups</h1>
    <p>
        Following the Brand Identity process, it was integral to show the
        multiple varying ways that the new established brand can be utilized,
        featuring multiple different forms of Mockups to represent the brand,
        ranging from Signage, merchandise and business supplies

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        The intense researching of the Japanese Metropolitan Government was a
        tough task as much of the recorded information was in Japanese, but it
        still provided me with the information needed to begin the reworking
        project; and with that knowledge I was able to combine the information
        gained with the history of Japan and the cultural symbolism altogether
        allowed me to produce the end result which I believe accurately
        represents Japans history while tying in with Japans Future.
