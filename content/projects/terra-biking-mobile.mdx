description: Terra Biking’s Mobile project is a complimenting project to Terra Biking PC that focused on the consistent aesthetic and visual design of its PC counterpart, I wanted to capture the continuous sleek nature and identity that Terra Biking portrays in their values and design and what these pillars represent, a natured night sky, mountainous terrain and strong modernistic design in perfect balance.

<h1>Strategy & UX</h1>

<p>
    The primary goal of the project was to further enhance the useability of the
    site, implementing ease of life interactivity for the user to have access
    to, such as a day/night mode, the option to an create account, access to
    account settings, options to browse the store and deals and successfully
    purchasing items from the cart; creating an easy user flow was integral to
    the design so that the users don’t get lost in the menus and allowing them
    to directly find what they’re looking to access.
</p>

<p>
    I began conducting user Research by browsing competitor sites that primarily
    catered to mobile shopping and engaged in competitive/comparative analysis
    to understand and utilize the best practices and opportunities for user flow
    to gain an advantage in user flow.
</p>

<p>
    I also began conducting user research via feedback from users who accessed
    competitor sites; this allowed me to understand user expectations and needs
    when accessing the user flow of a website; using this information gained I
    focused on creating a flow that was concise and clear, allowing for
    intuitive navigation and easy access to important features and informational
    sources that the user may desire in their flow of the site.
</p>

<p>
    Below is a set of wireframe samples I had created during the research and UX
    phase of the project, the goal of the wireframe was to create an efficient
    and informative use of user time and flow to access all the important
    sources of information.

        <h1>Aesthetics & UI</h1>
        <p>
            In the desire of efficiency and consistency in design, I wanted to
            remain continuous with the PC aesthetic, using the colour palette
            and components showcased in both the design and by the business
            itself, representing sleek modernistic design while holding onto its
            nature-oriented origin.
        </p>
        <p>
            This desire and goal to remain consistent in the design opened a new
            experience in the project, applying a day/night mode would assist in
            user control but also allowed the user to alternate different
            version of the site depending on what they desired at the time of
            use; it pushed the use of the components created for the project
            itself alongside user preference.

        <h1>User Control</h1>
        <p>
            The issue I found with research is that a lot of sites that use
            mobile stores was that there was always a risk for the user to get
            lost in the menus, so I decided on following a hierarchy of
            information that the user would naturally flow through in terms of
            priority, such as deals and title cards that scroll through varying
            sources of information, while also providing the user with tabs at
            the bottom and also a search function.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important that there were many different ways a user could
            access the desired information they were seeking, taking
            accessibility into account I wanted there to be icons that users
            could instantly understand and use for an even faster use of flow if
            they found the scrolls information tabs or the search bar to be less
            fruitful in their experience.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        It was an interesting experience creating a variation of a completed
        product, it let me experience issues that weren’t otherwise found in the
        original such as a day/night mode and reintegrating components that were
        previously created and used in the project and changing their elements
        to fit the new versions; this project also had a store integrated in the
        design that the previous iteration didn’t as it was mostly just for
        showing off the websites aesthetic and layout.
