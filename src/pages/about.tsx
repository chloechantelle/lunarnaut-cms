            <p className="about-page-content-body">Lunarnaut is an idea, a representation of the desire and determination to push the limits and beyond, to discover the vastness and wonder of discovery and innovation and implementing them within creative and unique projects.</p>

            <p className="about-page-content-body">Lunarnaut, is a fusion of two captivating concepts - "Lunar" and "Astronaut." "Lunar" symbolizes my fascination with space-faring of celestial space beings such as the moon, which represents the mystery and unknowing of the universe, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our terrestrial boundaries. "Astronaut," on the other hand, embodies the spirit of exploration, pushing boundaries, and venturing into these unknowns; and lastly, the dandelion, the desire to separate and push into uncharted territories and discover new methods and skills to integrate and expand, with these ideals I try to collectively incorporate them with all my designs, to dare to be adventurous and inspire by design.</p>
